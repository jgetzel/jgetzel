# Hi, I'm Jakob!

I'm a Software Engineer who has recently worked at Amazon, and a B.S. Computer Science
graduate from the University of California, San Diego. I have professional experience as a Full-Stack
Developer, deploying frontend and backend code that has been used at scale, working in Python, Java,
Typescript, and React. I am also a hobbyist game developer, who's worked on networked games in
Rust, C++, and C#/Unity.
